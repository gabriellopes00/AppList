# { Stocking : API } üì¶
## Building ‚öô
You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and i recommend that you have installed the [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) on your computer. With your setup completed, you will need to instal [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), and create an empty database called "stocking".

###### This API is not ready üö®
This API can menage a stock system easily, here you can menage (clients, products, providers, sales and supplies). This API can store purchase and sales data of the stock, as well as it can relate the data of buyers and providers with these actions. All the information can be stored and the relations can be done, **but...** the information is not updated dynamically, e.g. If a purchase is registered, the amount of products that were purchased will not be deducted from the stock, just as the registered supplies do not increase the amounts stored in the product table.
